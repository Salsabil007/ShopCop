# ShopCop
It is a simple web project. Here I have implemented a website for a super shop management. It has the inventory of the shop,
all products are displayed. It has three different functionalities for three types of user:
(1) Customer
(2) Cashier and Inventory Manager
(3) Manager

I have done it with Python and Django. For price calculation, I have to use the Web Development technique Ajax.
Thank you :)
